In-depth analysis is conducted to evaluate TheLook's performance over the past several years (2019-2025). This comprehensive review provides valuable insights that internal cross-functional teams will utilize to streamline processes and enchance TheLook's commercial performance. The key insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

### Key Metrics & North Star Framework

- **Revenue & Transaction Value (The Value Pillar):** Monitoring Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and total sales revenue over specific periods. This includes tracking the number of successful transactions and Average Order Value (AOV) to understand spending patterns.
- **Conversion & Funnel Efficiency (The Reach Pillar):** Evaluating the conversion rate from website visitors to completed purchases. This involves identifying "friction points" in the user journey and assessing funnel effectiveness to maximize customer acquisition and initial retention.
- **Customer Loyalty & Retention (The Stickiness Pillar):** Analyzing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to ensure the cost of acquisition is sustainable. This focuses on long-term profitability and reducing "One-Time Buyer" rates through repeat purchase analysis.
- **Quality & Operational Excellence (The Quality Pillar):** Analyzing product performance, market impact, and return/refund rates across different categories. This informs strategic decisions on inventory and identifies quality issues to minimize operational loss.

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

TheLook eCommerce is a comprehensive, synthetic dataset hosted on BigQuery Public Data. It consists of seven main tables containing over 120,000+ transactional records. The dataset provides a holistic view of a digital retail business, including:
- **distribution_centers:** Locations of physical warehouses.
- **events:** User behavior logs (page views, cart additions, etc.) for funnel and conversion analysis.
- **inventory_items:** Detailed stock records, including product costs and warehouse entry dates.
- **order_items:** Granular, item-level transaction history, including sale prices and specific fulfillment statuses.
- **orders:** High-level transaction records containing order metadata (user ID, order timestamp).
- **products:** Product catalog featuring category names, brands, and retail prices.
- **users:** Customer demographic profiles including age, gender, and registration details.

Initial Data Audit 
Conducted an initial data audit on the raw dataset and found several issues that required cleaning:
- **Date Range Validation:** Removed future-dated transactions (beyond Jan 2026) to ensure historical accuracy.
- **Order Status Distribution:** Identify orders value based on status (Complete, Cancelled, Returned, Shipped, Processing).
- **Data Integrity Check:** Evaluating relationship between tables.
- **Unique Visitors & Sessions:** Analyzing traffic volume from events table for preparing the conversion rate.
- **Schema Refinement:** Performed a 3-way join between orders, products, and users to create a unified Gold Table for easier visualization.

## Executive Summary

## Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
